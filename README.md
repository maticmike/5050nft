Website & Smart Contracts by Mike Dev.  

Assets are generated and stored in IPFS for all rarities of all tokens. There is no pre-determined rarity for token ids, it is all assigned on mint by chainlink vrf.  

This is a client project for a fully on chain fifty fifty raffle with 3 rarities that allow for multiple entries into special drawings. The contract utilizes chainlink for both rarity assignment as well as drawing winners without the use of any off-chain logic. All winners are emitted in events that are completely tracable and payouts will be in tx log.  

*Mike Dev has no ownership of this project, and was hired to develop the website, smart contracts, and server infrastructure.*
